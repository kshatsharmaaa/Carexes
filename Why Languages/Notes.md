Languages are used to write applications and developers are dumb to code in 0s and 1s which gets stored in RAM.
Developers write high level code in these languages.
Every language has the compiler which converts the developer code into 01
The c++ compiler is called g++
c++ is a compiled language
usually dont compile if there's an error in the code
eg: c++, java, rust, golang
3 steps : write code, compiled code, run the code(put it in ram)
But JS is different(interpreted)
2 steps: write code, run code
it is going line by line not whole at once
can run partially if the error comes later
eg: js, py
